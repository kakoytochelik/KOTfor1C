# Change Log

# 1.11.3
- **Deprecated release**:
    - Extension `AlexeyEremeev.1c-drive-test-helper` has been moved to deprecated status.
    - Added explicit end-of-life notice for the old ID in `README`.
    - Added link to the new extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AlexeyEremeev.kot-test-toolkit
    - Updated old extension icon (deprecated label) to make migration clearer.

# 1.11.2
- **New Features**:
    - **Build Scenario Parameters Manager:**
        - New interface for managing `yaml_parameters.json` parameters through a convenient key-value table.
        - Default parameters generated based on extension settings (BuildPath, yamlSourceDirectory).
        - Secure storage of settings in VS Code SecretStorage.
        - Support for loading/saving parameters from/to JSON files.
        - The list of supported parameters is available [on ITS](https://its.1c.ru/db/sppr2doc#content:124:hdoc:issogl1_11.8.3).
- **Fixes**:
    - **Fixed refresh button unavailability:** The "Refresh" button is now always available, even when no tests are found for the Phase Switcher.
    - **Fixed hardcoded paths:** Replaced hardcoded `SCAN_DIR_RELATIVE_PATH` constant with the `YamlSourceDirectory` setting.
    - Fixed untranslated messages and tooltips.
    - Fixed wrongly added empty string in the NestedScenario section.
    - Tabs are now replaced only at the beginning of a line.
    - The FirstLaunch file assembly now processes only the necessary XML files.
    - Creating new main scenarios now takes into account the ModelBDid setting (specified in the Build Scenario Parameters Manager).
    - Auto-replacement of tabs and refilling of blocks in the header of scenarios, as well as auto-completion suggestions for steps, now only work in YAML files that have the string `ТипФайла: "Сценарий"` (`FileType: “Scenario”`) (it is a protection of YAML files that are not related to tests).
- **Removed**:
    - **YAML Parameters Template setting:** Removed in favor of the new Build Scenario Parameters Manager.
    - **Split Feature Files setting:** Removed as it's now configured through the Build Scenario Parameters Manager.
    - **BuildScenarioBDD Parameters setting:** Removed as all parameters are now managed through the Build Scenario Parameters Manager.

# 1.10.6
- Fixed saving parameter values when the value is an empty string.

# 1.10.5
- **New Features**:
    - **Auto-fill on Save:**
        - Added automatic filling of NestedScenarios and ScenarioParameters sections when saving YAML files.
        - New "clear and refill" logic ensures correct element order according to scenario text.
        - Preservation of custom parameter values (`Значение: "Value"` field) during auto-fill.
        - Separate settings for each function: tab replacement, nested scenarios filling, parameters filling.
        - Unified progress bar and consolidated notifications about completed operations.
        - Automatic file saving after processing to prevent displaying unsaved changes.
    - **Performance Optimization:**
        - **Startup Cache Initialization:** Workspace scanning and scenario cache building happens immediately on extension activation, not on first panel opening.
        - **Scenario UID Caching:** Added extraction and caching of UIDs from ДанныеСценария blocks for fast access.
        - **Optimized Nested Scenarios Filling:** Using cache instead of file system search speeds up operation 25-50x.
        - **Optimized Scenario Opening:** Instant scenario opening through cache instead of slow file search (50-100x speedup).
- **Fixes**:
    - **Unified Logic:** Manual commands and auto-save use the same "clear and refill" logic.
    - **Improved Parameter Handling:** Correct scenario parameter detection (only `_`, `-`, letters and digits).

# 1.9.9
- **New Features**:
    - **Configurable 1C Startup Parameters:**
        - Added ability to configure all 1C:Enterprise startup parameters through a single settings string.
        - Separate setting for additional `/C` parameters for BuildScenarioBDD (СборкаТекстовСценариев) processing. Read more about parameters [here](https://its.1c.ru/db/sppr2doc#content:124:hdoc) (Russian).
    - **Configurable Project Paths:**
        - All previously hardcoded paths can now be configured through extension settings.
        - Optional EPF files (`RepairTestFile.epf`) - processing is skipped if path is not set.

    - **Scenario creation:**
        - When creating main or nested scenario, an empty files folder is now automatically created for accompanying files (unification).

# 1.6.2
- **New Features**:
    - Since `NestedScenarios` and `ScenarioParameters` sections can contain many blocks, for improved navigation convenience and readability, automatic collapsing of these sections when opening test file has been added. Toggleable in settings.

# 1.6.1
- **Fixes and Improvements:**
    - Added auto-numbering for auto-filled blocks in `NestedScenarios` and `ScenarioParameters` sections.
    - Improved indentation and line break logic for auto-filled blocks in `NestedScenarios` and `ScenarioParameters` sections.
    - Fixed and accelerated parsing of scenarios with special characters for auto-filling blocks in `NestedScenarios` and `ScenarioParameters` sections.

## 1.6.0
- **Auto-fill "NestedScenarios" section:**
    - By context menu command `1C:Drive - Fill NestedScenarios section`, the section is automatically filled with missing blocks for called scenarios.
- **Auto-fill "ScenarioParameters" section:**
    - By context menu command `1C:Drive - Fill ScenarioParameters section`, the section is automatically filled with missing blocks for parameters used in the scenario.
- **Replace tabs with spaces:**
    - By context menu command `1C:Drive - Replace tabs with spaces`, all tab indentation is replaced with 4 spaces.
- **Removed old commands from context menu:** (_they are still available from palette_)
    - `1C:Drive - Insert NestedScenarios block`
    - `1C:Drive - Insert ScenarioParameters block`

## 1.5.2
- **Improved "NestedScenarios" block insertion:**
    - Auto-fill from selection: If a line corresponding to scenario call is selected when calling the command, the extension will now try to find the file of this scenario.
    - In case of success, `UIDNestedScenario` and `ScenarioName` fields in the inserted block will be automatically filled with `UID` and `Name` values from the found scenario file.
    - If the scenario file is not found, or UID/Name could not be extracted from it, the block will be inserted with empty values, as before.
- **Context menu sections**:
    - Context menu items are divided into 3 categories:
        - Navigation
        - Creation
        - Editing

## 1.5.0
- **Autocompletion for nested scenario calls:**
    - When entering text in `ScenarioText:` block, autocompletion options are suggested not only for standard Gherkin steps, **but also for calls to all found scenarios**.
    - If the selected scenario for insertion contains parameters, it is inserted as a multi-line snippet, including scenario name and lines for each parameter with placeholders for their values. 
    - The list of scenarios and their parameters for autocompletion is updated when pressing the "Refresh" button on the "1C:Drive Test Helper" panel (together with updating data for Phase Switcher).

- **External loading of Gherkin step definitions:**
    - Added ability to load `steps.htm` file (used for autocompletion and hints) from external URL. This allows updating step definitions without updating the entire extension.
    - In extension settings, user can specify URL for `steps.htm` file (default link to file in repository is set). If left empty, only local copy from extension will be used.
    - Caching mechanism implemented: loaded file is saved locally and used for 24 hours or until next URL change.
    - Added new command to command palette: `1C:Drive - Refresh step library`. This command forcibly loads `steps.htm` from specified URL and updates cache.
    - In case of external resource unavailability or loading error, extension will use data from cache (if valid) or, as last resort, local copy of `steps.htm` included in extension, to ensure continuous operation.

- **Scenario creation buttons:**
    - Added buttons for creating Main or Nested scenarios to Phase Switcher panel.

- **Fixed:**
    - When creating new Main scenario, test list in Phase Switcher now automatically updates.

## 1.4.1
